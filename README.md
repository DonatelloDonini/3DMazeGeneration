# GET IT ON YOUR MACHINE (todo)
// the list of commands to get the repository code on your machine

# VERSIONS
## V 1.0.0:
- Support for flat mazes
- Dynamic generation

## V 1.1.0  (current update):
- Support for multi-level mazes
- Performance optimizations
- Loop closure

## V 1.2.0 (future update):
- A placeholder model of the robot is shown navigating the maze

## V 1.3.0 (future update):
- The best path to point A to point B is visualized to debug the pathfinding algorithm internal to the robot

## Technical details
The matrix is not pre-defined, because of that, there is the possibility to visualize a mazes big as the computational limit of your machine.
