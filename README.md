# 3DMazeGeneration
A JS-based web interface to visualize 3D models of a certain Rescue Maze map based on a set (a sequence) of packages sent from a robot.

## V 1.0.0:
- Support for flat mazes
- Dynamic generation

## V 1.1.0:
- Support for multi-level mazes (work in progress)
- Performance optimizations

## Technical details
The matrix is not pre-defined, because of that, there is the possibility to visualize a mazes big as the computational limit of your machine.
